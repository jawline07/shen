         <p>Shenbagam mam .......u have always been the most sweetest person I have met in my life so far I really mean it
           from my heart mam ❤ After one month one joining in a new school getting into an new atmosphere you were the first
           person whom I felt too comfortable....I have never felt tat you are our class teacher you were too friendly towards us
            you never treated us as your students you always saw us as your own child I really missed you when we came to 12th std and the
            bitter truth was I know I was the major reason why our batch alone had lost its wonderful class teacher ....
            I felt guilty for this from long time I never had an chance to convey it to you I'm really sorry for wat I have made back
            over there mamI was always surprised by your knowledge🤯💯❤ the way you explain things ,the way you observe things,
            the way you comfort others, being updated to the current generation ....and the most lovely thing in you for me
            is always your PATIENCE i have admired it alot mam 😍</p>

         <h3>Nesa part-2</h3>
         <p>I will never forget those advise you gave me ....... sad part is I haven't practiced those things at the right time.
            But they are quite helpful for me when I entered college . I never saw any teachers who is as supportive as you even after
            getting here in college I have always wondered Shenbagam mam was the only teacher who could possibly be friendly with
            whatever type of students she has 💯I can't explain my feelings about having you in my life with the words ...its
            too limited 😭😭😭Happy birthday 🎂 mam you are not only an amazing teacher you are an wonderful
            human being ❤ you are an great mother 👨‍👩‍👦 you are awesome influencer 😍you will be most trustworthy friend 🤙🏾you are the most
            supportive person tat one can get in their life 💪🏻Even though you have years of birthdays you will always be
            young and shining in our hearts 💖I'm really sorry mam I couldn't keep in touch with you ...the course which
            I have got into has tied me up from all the ends ...😓
            Once again HAPPY BIRTHDAY SHENBAGAM mam 🥳❤🎂🧚🏼‍♂</p>
